Jasy - Web Tooling Framework
============================

Jasy is a powerful Python3-based tooling framework. It makes it 
easy to manage heavy web projects. Its main goal is to offer 
an API which could be used by developers to write their custom 
build/deployment scripts.


## Installation

There are [pre-built packages available for either Windows or Mac](https://github.com/zynga/jasy/downloads) 
users. Otherwise you can install Jasy on your own. Jasy has a few dependencies
like Python 3 (with PIP), Misaka (Markdown), Msgpack (API data), etc. For
details have a look at [the official documentation](https://github.com/zynga/jasy/wiki/Installation).


## Authors

Jasy was initially developed by Sebastian Werner <info@sebastian-werner.net> 
and is now continued as an official Zynga OpenSource project.
