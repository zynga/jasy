Jasy - Web Tooling Framework
============================

Jasy is a powerful Python3-based tooling framework. It makes it 
easy to manage heavy web projects. Its main goal is to offer 
an API which could be used by developers to write their custom 
build/deployment scripts.


## Installation

### Using Binary Packages

There are [pre-built packages available for either Windows or Mac](https://github.com/zynga/jasy/downloads) 
users.

### Custom Installation

You can also install Jasy on your own. Jasy has a few dependencies
like Python 3, Misaka (Markdown), Msgpack (API data), etc. For
